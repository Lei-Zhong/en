  In landscape design, we often create 3D models to explore how a space will look, feel, and function. These models allow us to visualize the interaction between elements—whether it’s a park, a public square, or a garden. The same tools and principles apply to environmental art in games. The focus shifts slightly—from real-world functionality to enhancing the player’s experience—but the goal remains the same: to craft spaces that are dynamic, engaging, and rich with stories.

Crafting Stories Through Digital Landscapes
{:.lead}

As a landscape architect, I’ve always been drawn to the power of space—the way a well-designed landscape can evoke emotions, tell a story, and create an immersive experience. This interest naturally extended into the digital world, where the art of creating 3D environments for games mirrors many of the same principles as landscape architecture. Whether designing physical spaces or virtual worlds, my passion lies in shaping environments that are both visually stunning and filled with meaning.

## Blurring the Line Between Physical and Digital Spaces
In both physical and virtual landscapes, the key is designing environments that feel alive. In the real world, this involves working with materials, plants, and natural systems to create spaces that grow and evolve over time. In digital spaces, the focus is on how to bring these elements to life through textures, lighting, and interactivity. The virtual world offers a level of creativity and freedom that allows for pushing boundaries, from fantastical landscapes to entirely new ecosystems.

One of the exciting aspects of environmental art is its storytelling potential. Every rock, tree, or pathway can be part of a larger narrative. In game design, landscapes often become a character in themselves, playing a pivotal role in shaping the player’s journey. The landscapes I aim to create are more than just backdrops—they are immersive worlds where players can lose themselves, explore, and uncover hidden stories.

## Creating Immersive, Story-Driven Worlds
I’m particularly fascinated by how environmental design can enhance storytelling in games. The way a landscape is laid out—the lighting, the colour palette, the placement of key elements—can influence how a player feels and interacts with the space. A dense, overgrown forest might feel mysterious and foreboding, while an open, sunlit meadow can evoke feelings of peace and discovery. These design choices have the power to guide the player's experience without a single word being spoken.

My goal is to continue exploring how landscape design principles can be applied to create compelling virtual environments, whether through intricate map designs, 3D models, or fully realized game worlds. The intersection of landscape architecture and environmental design offers endless possibilities for crafting spaces that are not only beautiful but also deeply engaging and filled with meaning.
