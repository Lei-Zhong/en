Interactive Design: Bridging Virtual and Physical Spaces.
{:.lead}

In landscape architecture, design is fundamentally about people and their interactions with the spaces they inhabit. The integration of virtual experiences offers exciting possibilities for creating engaging and user-centred environments.

## Exploring Future Virtual Worlds
Imagine a virtual world crafted with the same care as a physical landscape, designed for meaningful interaction. Using landscape design skills, immersive environments can be created that invite users to explore and influence their surroundings. This approach encourages feedback and participation, deepening our understanding of how design impacts our lives.

## Enhancing Physical Experiences
Virtual experiences can enrich our interactions with the physical world. Merging virtual elements with tangible landscapes creates a dialogue that enhances user engagement. For example, augmented reality overlays can provide additional information about plants and wildlife, making the exploration of physical spaces more informative and enjoyable.

## Better User Interaction and Feedback
At the heart of this approach is the importance of user interaction. Incorporating feedback mechanisms into the design process ensures that spaces resonate with those who use them. Insights gained through user engagement help refine designs and enhance overall satisfaction.
